# malicious-url-detection


Detecting malicious URLs is a critical task in cybersecurity to safeguard
users from various online threats such as phishing, malware, and fraud. Machine
learning (ML) has emerged as a promising approach for automating this detection
process due to its ability to analyze vast amounts of data and identify patterns indicative
of malicious intent. This abstract presents an overview of the application of ML
techniques for malicious URL detection. The proposed system utilizes a dataset
consisting of labeled URLs, where each URL is classified as either benign or malicious
based on its characteristics and associated activities. Features extracted from these
URLs, including domain age, lexical features, and presence of suspicious keywords, are
used to train ML models. Various algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector
Machines, and Neural Networks are explored to build robust classifiers capable of
accurately distinguishing between benign and malicious URLs.
To enhance the performance of the detection system, feature engineering
techniques and model optimization methods are employed. Feature selection algorithms
are utilized to identify the most informative features, reducing dimensionality and
computational overhead. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation are
employed to optimize the performance of ML models and ensure generalizability.
Evaluation of the proposed system is conducted using standard metrics such as
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on separate training and testing datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ML-based approach in
accurately identifying malicious URLs while minimizing false positives. Furthermore,
the system exhibits resilience against adversarial attacks and can adapt to evolving
threats in the cybersecurity landscape.

Overall, the proposed ML-based approach offers a proactive and efficient
solution for detecting malicious URLs, thereby bolstering cybersecurity defenses and
safeguarding users against online threats.
